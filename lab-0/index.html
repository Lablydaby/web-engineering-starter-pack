            <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
            <p>
                Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
                Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I
                will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
            </p>

            <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
            <p>
                We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at
                any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at
                the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are
                as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Please let me know if this is acceptable, and if so, which start date you prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find more information about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0">important university dates</a> on our website.

            <h2>Subjects of Study</h2>
            <p>
                At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects
                fall somewhere in
                the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the
                kind of person we'd
                like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as
                follows, in order of priority:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of
                    Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at
                    temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size
                    exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.).
                </li>
                <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how
                long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and
                anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
            </p>

            <h2>Exotic Dance Moves</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study
                exotic tribal dances. My favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
            </p>
            <p>Polynesian Chicken Dance</p>
            <p class="indent">
                A little-known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back to 300 BC, where
                villagers would dance in a circle like chickens to encourage their
                livestock to be "fruitful".
            </p>
            <p>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle</p>
            <p class="indent">
                Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to
                practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the
                floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements.
                One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern
                styles such as Twerking.
            </p>
            <p>Arctic Robot Dance</p>
            <p class="indent">
                An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s
                believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted
                movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on
                however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were
                really cold.
